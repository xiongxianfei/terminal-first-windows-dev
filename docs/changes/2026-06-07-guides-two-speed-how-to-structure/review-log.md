## Plan Review Result - R1

- Skill: plan-review
- Status: completed
- Review status: changes-requested
- Material findings: PR-001
- Recording status: recorded

- Review resolution: not-required before fixing; required after revision only if the finding disposition needs separate explanation
- Reviewed plan: `docs/changes/2026-06-07-guides-two-speed-how-to-structure/plan.md`
- Immediate next stage: plan revision

Review date: 2026-06-07

### Review Inputs

- Plan under review: `docs/changes/2026-06-07-guides-two-speed-how-to-structure/plan.md`
- Spec: `specs/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.md`
- Spec review: `specs/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.review.md`
- Workflow guide: `docs/workflows.md`

### Findings

- PR-001: Test-spec artifact is assigned to an implementation milestone.

### Handoff

Changes requested. Revise the plan to keep `specs/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.test.md` as an upstream test-spec artifact rather than an implementation-owned M3 file, then rerun plan-review.

## Plan Review Resolution - PR-001

- Skill: plan
- Status: completed
- Finding: PR-001
- Resolution status: addressed-pending-second-pass-plan-review
- Recording status: recorded
- Resolution record: `docs/changes/2026-06-07-guides-two-speed-how-to-structure/review-resolution.md`
- Updated artifact: `docs/changes/2026-06-07-guides-two-speed-how-to-structure/plan.md`
- Next stage: plan-review second pass

Resolution date: 2026-06-07

### Resolution Summary

M3 no longer lists `specs/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.test.md` as an implementation-owned file or includes it in implementation-surface whitespace validation. The test spec remains upstream source evidence, and M3 now owns `tests/markdown/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.test.sh`.

## Test Spec Owner Approval

- Stage: test-spec
- Status: owner-approved

- Recording status: recorded
- Next stage: implement M1
