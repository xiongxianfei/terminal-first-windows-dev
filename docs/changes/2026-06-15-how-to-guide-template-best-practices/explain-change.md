# Explain Change: How-To Guide Template Best Practices

## Summary

This change turns the accepted two-speed guide direction into a concrete, reusable how-to guide authoring contract for `docs/guides/`. It updates the Markdown template, validates the proxy guide as a reference exemplar, converts `03-ubuntu-baseline.md` as the independent portability pilot, and adds static validation for guide structure, troubleshooting links, backup cues, guardrails, and proposal acceptance status.

All implementation milestones M1-M4 are closed after code review with no material findings. Final verification and PR handoff have not run.

## Problem

The repository already accepted two-speed how-to guides, but contributors still needed a copyable and reviewable template that prevents common drift: missing shell context, unclear expected results, fast paths that become too long, walkthroughs that become tutorials, missing backup or rollback guidance before machine-changing edits, and troubleshooting links placed only at the end.

This is safety-sensitive for this project because guides may touch WSL configuration, Ubuntu system files, sudoers behavior, mounts, shell profiles, editor runtime state, proxy behavior, and tmux configuration.

## Decision Trail

| Stage | Decision or evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Proposal | `docs/proposals/2026-06-15-how-to-guide-template-best-practices.md` selected a small required core plus conditional safety modules. |
| Proposal review | `docs/proposals/2026-06-15-how-to-guide-template-best-practices.review.md` approved the proposal after reframing `proxy-setup.md` as the reference exemplar and `03-ubuntu-baseline.md` as the non-circular portability pilot. |
| Spec | `specs/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.md` defined R1-R54 and AC1-AC14 for the template, published guides, backup guidance, validation boundaries, compatibility, and non-goals. |
| Spec review | `specs/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.review.md` approved the spec after `specs/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.review-resolution.md` addressed HGT-SR-001 by making backup guidance testable for file-editing guides. |
| Architecture | Architecture was not required because this is Markdown documentation structure and static validation, not generated assets, setup automation, data flow, or machine-changing runtime behavior. |
| Test spec | `specs/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.test.md` maps coverage to T1-T9, including template structure, guide conformance, backup-before-edit checks, troubleshooting links and anchors, validation boundaries, and AC1-AC14 proof. |
| Plan | `docs/changes/2026-06-15-how-to-guide-template-best-practices/plan.md` split implementation into M1 template, M2 exemplar/pilot, M3 validation, and M4 lifecycle evidence. |
| Code review | `review-log.md` records clean M1-M4 code reviews with no material findings. |

## Diff Rationale By Area

## Tests Added Or Changed

| Test or evidence | What it proves | Why this level is appropriate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/markdown/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.test.sh` | Proves stable Markdown structure, required metadata, command-context conventions, backup cues, guide section order, evidence records, troubleshooting links and anchors, no-command-execution boundaries, security-sensitive guardrails, and proposal accepted status. | The change is documentation-first, so static Markdown checks and review evidence match the risk without pretending to execute Windows + WSL setup commands. |
| `exemplar-review.md` | Records that `proxy-setup.md` is a reference exemplar and not the sole pilot. | The circularity concern is qualitative and needs durable review evidence. |
| `portability-pilot-review.md` | Records the non-exemplar pilot review, fast-path usability conditions, verification signal, and backup coverage. | Portability and skimmability cannot be fully proven by grep; the evidence record captures reviewer judgment without claiming command execution. |
| Code-review records M1-M4 | Show independent review of each implementation slice against the diff and governing artifacts. | The plan is milestone-based; each slice needs review before downstream closeout. |

## Validation Evidence Available Before Final Verify

Recorded validation includes:

- `bash -n tests/markdown/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.test.sh && bash tests/markdown/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.test.sh`
- `rg -n 'status: accepted|^## Status$|^accepted$' docs/proposals/2026-06-15-how-to-guide-template-best-practices.md`
- `rg` checks for template metadata, sections, backup guidance, command context, expected results, rollback, troubleshooting, and evidence-file existence
- `git diff --check`
- `git diff --cached --check`
- `git show --check --format=short HEAD`

Important limits:

- No hosted CI result has been claimed.
- No guide command block has been executed as setup validation.
- No Windows 11 + WSL runner result has been claimed.

## Review Resolution Summary

There are no material code-review findings to resolve. M1, M2, M3, and M4 code reviews are recorded as `clean-with-notes` with no material findings in `docs/changes/2026-06-15-how-to-guide-template-best-practices/review-log.md`.

The only spec-review finding requiring resolution was HGT-SR-001, recorded in `specs/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.review-resolution.md`; it was addressed before implementation by making backup guidance testable and adding the proxy fast-path backup cue.

## Alternatives Rejected

- **Exemplar-only, no template file:** rejected because contributors need a copyable authoring artifact, not just an example guide.
- **Headings-only template:** rejected because it would not prevent missing shell context, expected results, backup cues, or rollback guidance.
- **Strict all-sections-required template:** rejected because simple guides would accumulate filler and lose the fast-path benefit.
- **Generated scaffolder or template engine:** rejected as premature and outside the documentation-first scope.
- **Command-execution CI in the first slice:** rejected because Windows + WSL runner assumptions and command contracts are not settled.
- **Renaming `docs/guides/03-ubuntu-baseline.md`:** rejected for this slice; the existing path remains the portability pilot until broader guide migration chooses final task-scoped filenames.

## Scope Control

This change does not:

- convert every guide;
- change PowerShell, WSL, Ubuntu, Neovim, tmux, proxy, sudoers, fstab, mount, or package-source command semantics;
- add a one-command installer, hidden automation, generated documentation site, scaffolder, wizard, or template engine;
- add command-execution CI;
- require a Windows + WSL CI runner;
- move deep troubleshooting into guide pages;
- claim final verification, branch readiness, PR body readiness, or PR open readiness.

## Risks And Follow-Ups

- Static checks are intentionally grep-based and can miss some Markdown edge cases. Code review accepted this as appropriate for the first slice.
- The proof script does not prove that setup commands work on a real Windows 11 + WSL machine; command execution remains a deferred follow-up.
- Future guide conversions still need human review for fast-path skimmability, walkthrough usefulness, and safety judgment.
- Final verification and PR handoff remain downstream stages after this explanation.

## Current State

The active plan says M1-M4 are closed after code review, no implementation milestones remain, and the next stage is final closeout. This explanation is a final-closeout input before `verify`; it does not claim final verification or PR readiness.
