# PR Handoff: Remaining Guides Template Rollout

## Title

docs: roll out guide template to remaining guides

## PR Open Status

- Status: prepared-pending-open.
- URL: pending.
- Local branch: `proposal/other-guides-template-rollout`
- Base branch: `main`
- Blocker: none.

## Summary

- Convert the remaining first-slice guides to the accepted how-to guide shape with visible metadata, fast paths, walkthroughs, expected results, backup guidance, rollback, and troubleshooting routing.
- Split WSL fresh install and WSL migration into separate task guides while preserving `02-wsl2-ubuntu.md` as a command-free compatibility path.
- Convert `99-verification.md` only after active referenced paths exist or unresolved targets are inventoried.
- Add a scoped rollout proof script and lifecycle evidence for implementation reviews, explanation, verification, and PR handoff.

## Why

- The repository already accepted the two-speed guide structure and reusable guide template, but several first-slice guides still used the older structure.
- The rollout needed to improve skimmability and safety without changing approved Windows, WSL, Ubuntu, Neovim, tmux, uv, or verification command semantics.
- WSL migration and verification needed explicit compatibility and sequencing evidence to avoid broken links, duplicated commands, or destructive-operation ambiguity.

- Plan: `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/plan.md`
- Architecture / ADRs: not required; this change is Markdown guide structure, router updates, compatibility stubs, static checks, and review evidence only.

- Verify report: `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/verify-report.md`

## What changed

- `docs/guides/05-tmux.md`, `04-neovim.md`, and `06-uv.md`: converted smaller tool guides first while preserving numbered paths and optional uv status.
- `docs/guides/01-windows-host.md`: converted as one unified Windows host guide with policy and elevation notes near relevant commands.
- `docs/guides/wsl-ubuntu-install.md` and `docs/guides/wsl-ubuntu-migration.md`: added separate task guides for WSL fresh install and migration.
- `docs/guides/02-wsl2-ubuntu.md`: replaced the old full guide body with a command-free compatibility stub that routes by starting state.
- `docs/guides/99-verification.md`: converted to the accepted guide shape after adding `verification-target-inventory.md`.
- `docs/guides/README.md`: updated router entries while numbered and task-scoped paths coexist.
- `tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh`: added scoped structure, link, compatibility, security/privacy, verification sequencing, and lifecycle evidence checks.
- Existing Markdown checks were updated only where old wording assumptions conflicted with the accepted converted-guide shape.
- Change-local artifacts record proposal/spec/test-spec/plan/review/explanation/verification/PR evidence.

## Review resolution summary

- Accepted: 0 implementation review findings
- Rejected: 0
- Deferred: 0
- Partially accepted: 0
- Needs decision: 0
- Review-resolution: not required for implementation code-review findings

Spec-review finding RGT-SR-001 was resolved before implementation in `specs/remaining-guides-template-rollout.review-resolution.md`.

## Risks and rollback

- Static checks validate Markdown structure, links, compatibility boundaries, security/privacy guardrails, and lifecycle evidence; they do not execute workstation setup commands.
- Hosted CI was not observed because no `.github` workflow directory exists in this workspace.
- Broad final filename migration remains deferred to a later compatibility slice.
- `03-ubuntu-baseline.md`, WSL config, data mount, locale, and sudo verification targets remain unresolved verification follow-ups rather than active converted-guide links.
- Rollback can revert the converted guide bodies, WSL split/stub, router update, rollout proof script, and change-local artifacts from this branch. No runtime scripts, generated docs, or machine-changing automation were added.

## Reviewer notes

- Focus on command-semantics preservation while guide bodies moved into the template shape.
- Pay close attention to the WSL split: the old numbered path should route only and must not duplicate WSL install, migration, unregister, import, or import-in-place commands.
- Check that fast paths stay short enough to skim and that backup/export guidance appears before file edits or destructive persistent changes.
- The rollout proof intentionally remains local/static and avoids command execution by design.

## Follow-ups

- Broad final unnumbered filename migration remains a later compatibility slice.
- Command-execution validation remains deferred until command contracts and a Windows + WSL runner model are settled.
