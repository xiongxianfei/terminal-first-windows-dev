# Verify Report: Remaining Guides Template Rollout

## Result

- Skill: verify
- Status: completed
- Artifacts changed: `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/verify-report.md`, lifecycle handoff metadata, and the rollout proof's final-closeout assertions
- Open blockers: none
- Next stage: pr
- Validation: passed local static Markdown and whitespace checks
- Readiness: branch-ready

## Verification verdict

Ready for PR handoff.

The final change pack is coherent: implementation milestones M1-M5 are closed after code review, no material implementation findings require review-resolution, the durable explanation exists, and final local validation passed.

This report does not claim PR body readiness, PR open readiness, hosted CI success, or execution of workstation setup commands.

## Traceability table

| Requirement group | Test IDs | Files changed | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1-R26 converted guide contract and safety rules | `T-RGT-001`, `T-RGT-002`, `T-RGT-003`, `T-RGT-010`, `T-RGT-011`, `T-RGT-012` | Converted guides, rollout proof, review evidence | Rollout proof passed; M1-M5 reviews recorded clean-with-notes; explanation maps guide changes to requirements. | pass |
| R27-R39 smaller tool guides | `T-RGT-004`, `T-RGT-010`, `T-RGT-011` | `05-tmux.md`, `04-neovim.md`, `06-uv.md`, router, rollout proof | M1 evidence and code review recorded; validation passed. | pass |
| R40-R43 Windows host guide | `T-RGT-005`, `T-RGT-010` | `01-windows-host.md`, router, rollout proof | M2 evidence and code review recorded; validation passed. | pass |
| R44-R57 WSL split and compatibility stub | `T-RGT-006`, `T-RGT-010`, `T-RGT-012` | `wsl-ubuntu-install.md`, `wsl-ubuntu-migration.md`, `02-wsl2-ubuntu.md`, router, rollout proof | M3 evidence and code review recorded; validation passed. | pass |
| R58-R60 and R75 verification sequencing | `T-RGT-007` | `99-verification.md`, `verification-target-inventory.md`, rollout proof | M4 inventory and review recorded; active references exist or are unresolved follow-ups; validation passed. | pass |
| R61-R66 router and filename-migration boundaries | `T-RGT-008`, `T-RGT-009` | `docs/guides/README.md`, WSL stub, numbered paths | Router remains active; broad filename migration remains deferred; validation passed. | pass |
| R67-R74 static checks, review evidence, completion evidence | `T-RGT-010`, `T-RGT-012`, `T-RGT-013` | `tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh`, plan, review log, explanation | Proof script passed; review evidence exists; explanation and this verify report record checks and non-claims. | pass |
| AC1-AC21 acceptance coverage | `T-RGT-001` through `T-RGT-013` | Spec, test spec, guides, checks, lifecycle artifacts | Test spec maps AC1-AC21 to checks; final validation passed. | pass |

## Verification dimensions

| Dimension | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spec coverage | pass | Diff maps to `specs/remaining-guides-template-rollout.md`; no unplanned setup behavior was identified. |
| Requirement satisfaction | pass | Static checks and milestone review evidence cover the spec's MUST requirements for converted guide structure, compatibility, backup, rollback, and no command execution. |
| Test coverage | pass | `specs/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.md` maps R1-R75 and AC1-AC21 to `T-RGT-001` through `T-RGT-013`; related legacy checks also passed. |
| Test validity | pass | The plan records failing pre-implementation proofs for milestone gates; final checks assert concrete paths, headings, links, and lifecycle non-claims. |
| Architecture coherence | pass | Architecture/ADRs are not triggered; the implementation is Markdown guide structure, router updates, compatibility stubs, static checks, and review evidence only. |
| Artifact lifecycle state | pass | `change.yaml`, `docs/plan.md`, and the plan body agree that final verification is recorded and PR handoff is next. |
| Plan completion | pass | M1-M5 are closed; final closeout remains active only because PR handoff has not run. |
| Validation evidence | pass | Final local commands are listed below and passed. |
| Drift detection | pass | Explanation, plan, test spec, and actual diff agree on converted guides, compatibility paths, deferred filename migration, and validation boundaries. |
| Risk closure | pass | Command execution remains intentionally not run; WSL and uv risks are covered by review evidence and static checks; hosted CI is not claimed. |
| Release readiness | pass | Local branch-ready evidence is complete for PR handoff; PR body/open readiness remains owned by the PR stage. |

## Validation commands

Run from `/home/xiongxianfei/data/20260524-terminal-dev` on 2026-06-16.

| Command | Result | Notes |

| `bash tests/markdown/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.test.sh` | pass | Upstream template and pilot contract check. |
| `bash tests/markdown/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.test.sh` | pass | Upstream two-speed guide structure check. |
| `bash tests/markdown/m1-project-entrypoint.test.sh` | pass | Existing project entrypoint regression check. |
| `bash tests/markdown/m2-windows-wsl-storage.test.sh` | pass | Existing Windows/WSL/storage regression check. |

## CI status

Hosted CI: not observed.

There is no `.github` directory in this workspace, so no repository-hosted workflow definition was available to inspect or run. This report claims local validation only.

## Artifact drift findings

None blocking.

- `docs/plan.md` and `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/plan.md` both hand off to `pr`.
- `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/change.yaml` records `current_stage: verified` and `next_stage: pr`.
- `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/explain-change.md` points to this verify report and still leaves PR readiness unclaimed.
- No implementation `review-resolution.md` is required because M1-M5 code reviews recorded no material findings.

## Remaining risks

- PR body readiness and PR open readiness are not claimed; the PR stage owns those.
- Hosted CI was not observed.
- Guide command blocks were not executed by design. The approved validation model for this rollout is static and review-based.
- Broad final filename migration remains deferred.
- `03-ubuntu-baseline.md`, WSL config, data mount, locale, and sudo verification targets remain unresolved verification follow-ups rather than active converted-guide links.

## Handoff

Branch-ready for PR handoff.

Next stage: `pr`.
