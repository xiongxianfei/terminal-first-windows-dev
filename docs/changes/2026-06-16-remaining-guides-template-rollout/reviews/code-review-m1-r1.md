## Diff Summary

M1 converted `docs/guides/05-tmux.md`, `docs/guides/04-neovim.md`, and `docs/guides/06-uv.md` to the accepted visible metadata, `Fast path`, `Walkthrough`, `Rollback`, and `Troubleshooting` shape.

The diff added `tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh` for milestone-scoped converted-guide checks and updated legacy Markdown checks so converted guides can coexist with still-unconverted numbered guides.

The diff also recorded the accepted proposal/spec/test-spec workflow artifacts for this change and added M1 implementation evidence.

## Findings

No blocking or required-change findings.

## Checklist Coverage

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spec alignment | pass | M1 covers R27-R39 by converting `05-tmux.md`, `04-neovim.md`, and `06-uv.md` at their numbered paths; guide-specific requirements for tmux scope, Neovim dual-environment coverage, runtime-state separation, uv optionality, and package-index boundaries are present in the changed guides. |
| Test coverage | pass | `tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh` checks converted guide shape, backup cues, guide-specific M1 requirements, router uv optionality, security patterns, troubleshooting anchors, and M1 evidence. Legacy checks were updated for converted-guide coexistence. |
| Edge cases | pass | Direct proof exists for EC5 through uv credential-free examples and T-RGT-011 checks; converted-guide coexistence is covered by the updated entrypoint check and scoped rollout script. |
| Error handling | pass | Backup-before-edit coverage appears before `~/.tmux.conf`, `%LocalAppData%\nvim`, `~/.config/nvim`, `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.toml` edits; rollback sections remain present. |
| Architecture boundaries | pass | The change is documentation and static checks only. No scripts, generated docs, installers, or setup automation were introduced. |
| Compatibility | pass | Existing numbered paths for M1 guides are preserved, and the static checks are scoped so unconverted guides do not fail solely for old structure. |
| Security/privacy | pass | uv package-index examples use `https://example.org/simple`; proof checks reject credential-like patterns and private-looking hosts. No private credentials or hostnames were observed in reviewed guide examples. |
| Derived artifact currency | pass | No generated artifacts are involved. Durable workflow artifacts were added and referenced consistently. |
| Unrelated changes | pass | The diff is limited to accepted rollout proposal/spec/test-spec artifacts, M1 guide conversion, M1 tests, lifecycle metadata, and M1 evidence. |
| Validation evidence | pass | The cited validation commands were rerun during review and passed. |

## Validation Evidence

Review reran these commands successfully:

```bash
bash tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m1-project-entrypoint.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m2-windows-wsl-storage.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m3-ubuntu-baseline.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m4-neovim-tmux.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m5-release-readiness.test.sh
git diff --check HEAD^ HEAD
```

## No-Finding Rationale

The actual M1 diff satisfies the approved first smaller-guide slice without broad filename migration or setup-command execution. The converted guides preserve the existing command paths while adding metadata, fast paths, walkthroughs, backup cues, expected results, rollback, and troubleshooting links. The new proof script directly covers the M1-specific requirements and the legacy checks still pass after being adjusted for converted-guide coexistence.

## Residual Risks

No material M1 residual risk identified. Later milestones still need separate review for Windows host conversion, WSL split, verification sequencing, and lifecycle closeout.

## Handoff

M1 is closed. Next stage is `implement` for M2. No review-resolution is required.
