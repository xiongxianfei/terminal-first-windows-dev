## Diff Summary

M2 converted `docs/guides/01-windows-host.md` to the accepted visible metadata, `Fast path`, `Walkthrough`, `Rollback`, and `Troubleshooting` shape while keeping it one unified Windows host guide.

The diff extended `tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh` for Windows host conversion and updated the legacy Windows/WSL storage check to match the converted guide heading while preserving its command and policy assertions.

## Findings

No blocking or required-change findings.

## Checklist Coverage

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spec alignment | pass | M2 covers R40-R43: `01-windows-host.md` remains one guide, no Windows Terminal or PowerShell split files were introduced, and the guide preserves WinGet, Microsoft Store/App Installer, WSL availability, Windows Terminal, and PowerShell guidance. |
| Test coverage | pass | `tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh` now includes Windows host converted-guide checks, policy/elevation terms, host verification commands, and M2 evidence requirements. |
| Edge cases | pass | Policy and elevation-sensitive paths are covered by direct text checks and M2 implementation evidence. |
| Error handling | pass | The guide gives fallback behavior for blocked WinGet/package-source cases, `wsl --status` when `wsl --version` is unavailable, and rollback guidance for profile and PowerShell install paths. |
| Architecture boundaries | pass | The change is documentation and static validation only. No generated docs, installers, scripts, or setup automation were introduced. |
| Compatibility | pass | The numbered guide path remains `docs/guides/01-windows-host.md`, and the rollout check remains scoped to converted guides. |
| Security/privacy | pass | The guide warns against storing proxy credentials, tokens, private hostnames, or certificate material in the PowerShell profile and includes no credential-like examples. |
| Derived artifact currency | pass | No generated artifacts are involved. Plan, change metadata, review log, and M2 evidence were updated consistently. |
| Unrelated changes | pass | The diff is limited to Windows host conversion, M2 proof/evidence, lifecycle metadata, and the legacy check wording needed by the conversion. |
| Validation evidence | pass | The cited validation commands were rerun during review and passed. |

## Validation Evidence

Review reran these commands successfully:

```bash
bash tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m1-project-entrypoint.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m2-windows-wsl-storage.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m3-ubuntu-baseline.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m4-neovim-tmux.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m5-release-readiness.test.sh
git diff --check HEAD^ HEAD
```

## No-Finding Rationale

The actual M2 diff satisfies the approved Windows host conversion slice without splitting the guide, changing setup command semantics, or expanding filename migration. The converted guide keeps policy and elevation caveats close to affected commands and the proof script directly checks the M2-specific contract.

## Residual Risks

No material M2 residual risk identified. Later milestones still need separate review for WSL split, verification sequencing, and lifecycle closeout.

## Handoff

M2 is closed. Next stage is `implement` for M3. No review-resolution is required.
