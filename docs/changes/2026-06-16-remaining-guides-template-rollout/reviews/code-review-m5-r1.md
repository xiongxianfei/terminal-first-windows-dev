## Review Inputs

- Diff/review surface: `239ea5b M5: record rollout completion evidence`
- Tracked governing branch state: reviewed commit is present in local branch history
- Plan: `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/plan.md`
- Spec: `specs/remaining-guides-template-rollout.md`
- Test spec: `specs/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.md`
- Explanation record: `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/explain-change.md`
- Tests reviewed: `tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh`

## Diff Summary

M5 added `docs/changes/2026-06-16-remaining-guides-template-rollout/explain-change.md` with completion evidence for converted guides, compatibility paths, checks run, checks intentionally not run, command-execution non-claims, and remaining final-closeout gates.

The diff extended the rollout proof to require the explanation record and key non-claim fields, then updated lifecycle metadata and plan validation notes to make M5 review-requested without claiming final verification, branch readiness, or PR readiness.

## Findings

No blocking or required-change findings.

## Checklist Coverage

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spec alignment | pass | M5 satisfies R74 and AC16-AC21 by recording converted guides, compatibility paths, checks run, checks intentionally not run, verification inventory status, and remaining follow-ups. |
| Test coverage | pass | `tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh` now requires `explain-change.md` and checks converted guides, compatibility paths, checks, intentional non-execution, and non-claims for final verification, branch readiness, and PR readiness. |
| Edge cases | pass | The lifecycle evidence avoids overclaiming final verification or PR readiness before the owning stages run. |
| Error handling | pass | The plan remains non-terminal and active; final closeout is gated on `explain-change`, `verify`, and `pr` stages after M5 review. |
| Architecture boundaries | pass | The change is documentation and static proof only. No generated tooling, command-execution CI, or setup automation was introduced. |
| Compatibility | pass | The completion evidence preserves the WSL compatibility path and records `03-ubuntu-baseline.md` as an unresolved follow-up, not a converted guide. |
| Security/privacy | pass | The explanation includes no secrets, private hostnames, credentials, personal machine data, or private paths beyond documented generic examples. |
| Derived artifact currency | pass | No generated artifacts are involved. Plan, change metadata, review log, and explanation record are synchronized for the closeout handoff. |
| Unrelated changes | pass | The diff is limited to M5 closeout evidence, lifecycle metadata, and rollout proof assertions for that evidence. |
| Validation evidence | pass | The cited validation commands were rerun during review and passed. |

## Validation Evidence

Review reran these commands successfully:

```bash
bash tests/markdown/remaining-guides-template-rollout.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/how-to-guide-template-best-practices.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/guides-two-speed-how-to-structure.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m1-project-entrypoint.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m2-windows-wsl-storage.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m3-ubuntu-baseline.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m4-neovim-tmux.test.sh
bash tests/markdown/m5-release-readiness.test.sh
git diff --check HEAD^ HEAD
```

## No-Finding Rationale

The actual M5 diff provides the lifecycle closeout evidence required by the spec and test spec without changing guide behavior or claiming downstream gates. The proof script directly checks for the required evidence and non-claims.

## Residual Risks

No material M5 residual risk identified. Final verification and PR handoff are still separate downstream stages and are not claimed by this review.

## Handoff

M5 is closed. No implementation milestones remain. Next stage is final closeout via `explain-change`. No review-resolution is required.
