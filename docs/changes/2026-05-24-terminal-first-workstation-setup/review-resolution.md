## PR-001 - Full diff whitespace check is known to fail before implementation

Disposition: addressed.

The plan no longer requires repository-wide `git diff --check` as a milestone gate while the repository has known unrelated whitespace drift. Required whitespace validation is now scoped to the staged milestone diff:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
git diff --cached --check
```

The plan also records the known repository-wide baseline issue and keeps full `git diff --check` as advisory until the unrelated template/community whitespace baseline is resolved.

No owner decision was required because the review supplied a safe resolution path and did not require this change to clean unrelated template/community files.
