## Testing strategy

This test spec favors static documentation tests, syntax checks, contract checks, and manual Windows 11 walkthroughs because the first slice is documentation-first and many behaviors affect a user's machine.

- Unit strategy: use small static checks for required and forbidden strings, guide links, status vocabulary, rollback sections, config snippets, and helper-script declarations.
- Integration strategy: validate that README, numbered guides, config examples, helper scripts, verification guide, and troubleshooting docs agree on paths, commands, environments, status values, and rollback surfaces.
- End-to-end strategy: use manual Windows 11 walkthroughs for host setup, WSL fresh install-location, migration/import-in-place, Ubuntu launch, Windows Neovim, and WSL/Ubuntu verification.
- Smoke strategy: run syntax or startup checks where available, including shell syntax, PowerShell parser or analyzer checks, `nvim --version`, `tmux -V`, and clean config-load checks when the relevant runtime is present.
- Manual strategy: record command output for Windows-only or machine-changing paths instead of pretending they can be safely automated from the Linux workspace.
- Contract strategy: preserve exact command contracts for WSL install-location, WSL migration safety, helper write disclosure, doctor status values, and staged whitespace validation.
- Migration strategy: verify that existing Ubuntu migration requires shutdown, export or backup success, unregister warning, import-in-place, default distro reset, launch verification, and rollback before it is considered complete.

### T-M5-006. Helper write contract is enforced

- Covers: R37
- Level: contract
- Fixture/setup: Helper scripts and their guide sections exist.
- Steps: For each helper that writes files, verify docs and/or dry-run output disclose target path, backup behavior, rollback behavior, and user-local or machine-wide scope.
- Expected result: No helper silently edits sudoers, fstab, WSL config, profile files, or editor/terminal config.
- Failure proves: Automation violates the architecture safety boundary.
- Automation location: `tests/markdown/helper-write-contract.test.*` plus script contract checks.

## Fixtures and data

- Markdown fixtures: README, numbered guides, troubleshooting docs, release notes or version record, review artifacts, and this test spec.
- Windows fixture: Windows 11 machine with current WSL for manual host, WSL install-location, migration/import-in-place, and Windows Neovim checks.
- Ubuntu fixture: Ubuntu on WSL2, preferably disposable or backed up for sudoers, fstab, mount, and tmux checks.
- Disposable migration fixture: a non-production Ubuntu distro or backup/export used only for migration walkthroughs.
- Config fixtures: `config/nvim/` and `config/tmux/` once implemented.
- Script fixtures: `scripts/windows/*.ps1` and `scripts/ubuntu/*.sh` once implemented.
- No secrets, proxy credentials, private hostnames, token material, or private paths beyond documented examples may be used as fixtures.

## Mocking/stubbing policy

- Static documentation tests must inspect real repository files, not mocked docs.
- Script syntax tests may run without executing state-changing behavior.
- Machine-changing paths such as `wsl --unregister`, sudoers edits, fstab writes, and mount commands must be manual, dry-run, or performed only against disposable/backed-up fixtures.
- WSL negative-path behavior may use captured `wsl --help` excerpts or documented manual evidence when an old WSL version is not available.
- Proxy, PAC, corporate CA, and enterprise policy tests may use static/troubleshooting checks and manual notes; do not fabricate enterprise environment behavior.

## Migration or compatibility tests

- T-M2-002 is the primary migration test for existing Ubuntu to `D:\Software\WSL\Ubuntu`.
- T-SR001-008 covers compatibility when `--location` is unavailable.
- T-M2-001 covers Windows 11, Windows Terminal, PowerShell, WinGet, WSL, elevation, and enterprise-policy host compatibility.
- T-M3-001 covers proxy compatibility and first-slice PAC/custom CA deferral.
- T-M3-002 covers DrvFs direct-subdirectory mount fallback.
- T-M4-002 covers Windows versus Ubuntu Neovim differences.
- T-M4-003 and T-M4-004 cover tmux terminal compatibility and Ubuntu-only scope.

## Observability verification

- Doctor outputs must include layer names for Windows host, WSL storage, WSL config, Ubuntu baseline, proxy, data mount, locale, sudo, Neovim Windows, Neovim Ubuntu, and tmux Ubuntu.
- Doctor outputs must use pass, fail, skipped, or needs manual action and include a short remediation hint when failing.
- Verification docs must show the command used to observe each claim.
- Version recording must include PowerShell, WSL, Ubuntu distro, Neovim, tmux, and core lint/format tools when installed.

## Security/privacy verification

- Static checks must confirm warnings appear before destructive or sensitive commands, including `wsl --unregister`, sudoers edits, fstab writes, WSL global config, package sources, proxy settings, and administrator-sensitive Windows commands.
- Proxy docs must warn against putting credentials into shell history when secure alternatives exist.
- Passwordless sudo must be labeled as a local security tradeoff and must be opt-in.
- Tests and manual transcripts must not contain secrets, proxy credentials, tokens, private hostnames, or private machine paths beyond documented examples.

## Performance checks

- Static checks must confirm the guide warns that Linux-heavy project work generally belongs in the WSL filesystem, such as `~/src`, rather than mounted Windows paths.
- Static checks must confirm `D:\Data` and `/home/<user>/data` are described as shared data unless the user accepts mounted-drive performance tradeoffs.
- Doctor checks should be reviewed for repeatable runtime expectations; slow or interactive checks must be labeled before they run.
- No synthetic performance benchmark is required for the first slice.

## Manual QA checklist

- On Windows 11, record `pwsh`, `winget`, `wt`, and WSL availability checks.
- Record `wsl --version`, `wsl --help`, and `wsl --list --online` before fresh custom-location install.
- Select an explicit Ubuntu LTS distro name from `wsl --list --online`.
- Verify the fresh install command uses `wsl --install --distribution <UbuntuLtsDistroName> --location "D:\Software\WSL\Ubuntu"`.
- Verify `wsl --list --verbose` and distro launch after install.
- For migration, use only a backed-up or disposable distro; verify export/backup before any unregister command.
- Verify `D:\Data` to `/home/<user>/data` mount or fallback symlink and `sudo mount -a`.
- Verify locale output is UTF-8 and warning-free.
- If passwordless sudo is enabled, verify `visudo` and non-interactive sudo; if skipped, verify the skip path is documented.
- Verify Windows and Ubuntu Neovim independently.
- Verify Ubuntu tmux with `tmux -V` and clean config load.
- Record any unrun Windows-only checks honestly.

## What not to test and why

- Do not test Windows versions older than Windows 11; they are outside first-slice scope.
- Do not test arbitrary WSL storage roots; only `D:\Software\WSL\Ubuntu` is in scope.
- Do not test native Windows tmux support; the spec explicitly excludes it.
- Do not test full PAC setup or automatic corporate CA setup; first slice keeps corporate CA handling manual and troubleshooting-only.
- Do not test broad language runtime, Docker, database, cloud, Kubernetes, or AI tooling setup; those are non-goals.
- Do not execute destructive migration commands on a production distro during automated tests.
- Do not require repository-wide whitespace cleanup as part of this feature; use staged milestone-scoped whitespace validation.

## Uncovered gaps

None blocking. Windows-specific and machine-changing behavior requires manual verification or disposable fixtures because the current workspace cannot safely execute those paths.

## Next artifacts

- Implement M1.
- Add concrete test files under `tests/markdown/`, `tests/powershell/`, and `tests/shell/` as milestones introduce docs, scripts, and config.
- Update the active plan's progress and validation notes during implementation.

## Follow-on artifacts

None yet.

## Readiness

Active proof surface for implementation. Ready to implement M1. Readiness is not implementation completion, code-review approval, verification, branch readiness, or PR readiness.
