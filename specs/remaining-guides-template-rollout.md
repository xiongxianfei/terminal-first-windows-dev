- Setup command contract spec: `specs/terminal-first-workstation-setup.md`

## Goal and context

This spec defines the observable contract for applying the accepted how-to guide template to the remaining first-slice guides.

The project already has a two-speed guide structure, a reusable how-to guide template, a reference exemplar in `docs/guides/proxy-setup.md`, and a portability pilot in `docs/guides/03-ubuntu-baseline.md`. The remaining first-slice guides still mostly use the older `Purpose`, `Command environment`, `Safety notes`, `Validation`, and `Rollback` structure.

This rollout converts those remaining guides toward the accepted visible metadata, `Fast path`, `Walkthrough`, expected-result, backup, rollback, and troubleshooting-link contract. It also preserves current command semantics, keeps existing numbered paths usable during body conformance, and treats the WSL guide split as a safety exception rather than a broad filename-migration precedent.

The first conversion target set is:

```text
docs/guides/05-tmux.md
docs/guides/04-neovim.md
docs/guides/06-uv.md
```

Later conversion targets are:

```text
docs/guides/01-windows-host.md
docs/guides/wsl-ubuntu-install.md
docs/guides/wsl-ubuntu-migration.md
docs/guides/02-wsl2-ubuntu.md
docs/guides/99-verification.md
docs/guides/README.md
```

The accepted template exemplar and pilot remain:

```text
docs/guides/proxy-setup.md
docs/guides/03-ubuntu-baseline.md
```

## Glossary

- Body conformance: revising a guide's reader-facing structure to satisfy the accepted template contract while preserving the guide's approved command semantics.
- Converted guide: a guide that this rollout has brought into the accepted visible metadata, `Fast path`, and `Walkthrough` shape.
- Compatibility stub: a short document kept at an old numbered path that routes readers to canonical task-scoped guides without duplicating setup commands.
- First smaller-guide slice: the initial body-conformance target set for `05-tmux.md`, `04-neovim.md`, and `06-uv.md`.
- Final filename migration: a later compatibility slice that can create final unnumbered task-scoped guide paths and replace old numbered files with redirect-style stubs.
- Router: `docs/guides/README.md`, the reader-facing guide index that routes by intent.
- Setup command contract: approved setup behavior governed by `specs/terminal-first-workstation-setup.md`.
- WSL split: the safety-driven split of `02-wsl2-ubuntu.md` into separate fresh-install and migration guides during body conformance.
- Active verification reference: a link, matrix entry, command grouping, or router pointer in `docs/guides/99-verification.md` that tells the reader to verify a setup guide, setup path, or published guide target as part of the current verification flow.
- Unresolved verification follow-up: a clearly labeled pending target that is not presented as an active verification step because its converted guide path does not exist yet or its owning guide has not yet been converted.
- Verification target inventory: review evidence listing each setup-guide path referenced by `99-verification.md`, whether that path exists after the slice, whether it is converted or a compatibility path, and whether any missing target is recorded as a follow-up.

## Examples first

Example E1: first smaller-guide slice preserves command semantics
Given `docs/guides/05-tmux.md`, `docs/guides/04-neovim.md`, and `docs/guides/06-uv.md` contain approved setup guidance
When they are converted in the first rollout slice
Then each guide gains visible metadata, a fast path, a walkthrough, command context, expected results, backup guidance where applicable, and rollback without changing the approved setup commands.

Example E2: uv remains optional
Given a reader does not need optional Python tooling
When they open the guide router or `docs/guides/06-uv.md`
Then uv is labeled as optional and is not presented as required for the core terminal-first workstation setup.

Example E3: WSL install and migration split
Given fresh WSL install and existing-distro migration have different starting states and destructive-risk profiles
When the WSL guide is converted
Then fresh install content moves to `docs/guides/wsl-ubuntu-install.md`, migration content moves to `docs/guides/wsl-ubuntu-migration.md`, and `docs/guides/02-wsl2-ubuntu.md` becomes a short compatibility stub.

Example E4: compatibility stub avoids command drift
Given a reader follows an existing link to `docs/guides/02-wsl2-ubuntu.md`
When the compatibility stub is rendered
Then it routes the reader to install or migration task guides and does not duplicate WSL setup commands.

Example E5: Windows host stays unified
Given `docs/guides/01-windows-host.md` covers Windows Terminal, PowerShell, WinGet, WSL availability, and optional PowerShell profile behavior
When it is converted during body conformance
Then it remains one guide and does not split Windows Terminal and PowerShell into separate files during this rollout.

Example E6: verification becomes a guide-shaped proof surface
Given `docs/guides/99-verification.md` consolidates proof commands and publication gates
When it is converted
Then it includes a fast path for the minimum useful verification route and a walkthrough for the detailed matrix, result vocabulary, static checks, and rollback coverage.

R71. High-risk guide conversion review, including WSL migration and package-source guidance, MUST include manual or dry-run command review evidence.

R72. Missing troubleshooting anchors MUST be recorded as same-slice dependencies when the converted guide links to them, or as follow-ups when the guide uses a short local failure note instead.

R73. This rollout MUST NOT modify `docs/guides/proxy-setup.md` or `docs/guides/03-ubuntu-baseline.md` except for narrow router or link maintenance unless a later accepted artifact expands the scope.

- Router updates in `docs/guides/README.md`.
- Static checks or documented review evidence for converted-guide structure, troubleshooting links, backup-before-edit coverage, and parity.
- No command-execution CI, generated docs system, or hidden setup automation.

## State and invariants

- The project remains documentation-first.
- `docs/guides/` remains reader-facing how-to documentation.
- `docs/templates/how-to-guide.md` remains contributor-facing.
- `docs/troubleshooting/` remains the owner of deep recovery content.
- `specs/terminal-first-workstation-setup.md` remains authoritative for setup command semantics.
- Body conformance changes guide structure and presentation; it does not approve new setup behavior.
- Existing numbered paths remain usable until a compatibility path is in place.
- The WSL split is a safety exception for fresh-install and migration separation, not a general rename policy.
- Static checks prove structure and links, not machine setup correctness.
- `proxy-setup.md` remains the reference exemplar and `03-ubuntu-baseline.md` remains the existing portability pilot for the guide template.

## Error and boundary behavior

- If a converted guide changes setup command semantics beyond structure, review MUST treat the change as out of scope unless a later accepted spec authorizes it.
- If a converted guide lacks visible metadata, review or static checks MUST treat it as non-conformant.
- If a converted guide lacks `Fast path` or `Walkthrough`, review or static checks MUST treat it as non-conformant.
- If a converted guide's fast path and walkthrough conflict in high-level task order, review MUST require realignment or an explicitly labeled alternative path.
- If a converted guide shows a user-owned or system-owned file edit without backup guidance before the edit, review MUST treat backup guidance as missing.
- If backup is marked not applicable without a concrete reason, review MUST treat backup guidance as missing for hard-to-undo changes.
- If a converted guide contains unresolved placeholders or contributor-only comments, review or static checks MUST treat it as non-conformant.
- If a converted guide links to a missing troubleshooting file or anchor, link or anchor validation MUST fail unless the same slice creates the missing target.
- If no stable troubleshooting anchor exists for a known failure point, the converted guide MUST NOT invent a fake anchor.
- If `02-wsl2-ubuntu.md` duplicates WSL commands after the WSL split, review MUST treat the compatibility stub as non-conformant.
- If final filename migration begins before body conformance stabilizes, review MUST require a later accepted artifact that explicitly changes this spec's boundary.
- If a guide conversion needs a real command correction, that correction MUST be routed to a separate spec or bugfix unless it is a narrow editorial correction that does not change setup behavior.

## Compatibility and migration

- Existing numbered guide paths remain valid during body conformance.
- `05-tmux.md`, `04-neovim.md`, and `06-uv.md` keep their numbered filenames during the first smaller-guide slice.
- `01-windows-host.md` keeps its numbered filename and remains one guide during body conformance.
- `02-wsl2-ubuntu.md` changes role from full guide to compatibility stub only after `wsl-ubuntu-install.md` and `wsl-ubuntu-migration.md` exist.
- `99-verification.md` keeps its numbered filename during body conformance.
- Final task-scoped filename migration is deferred until a later compatibility slice.
- Short redirect-style stubs are the preferred final compatibility mechanism for old numbered paths.
- Router-only compatibility is insufficient for final filename migration because direct links and bookmarks to numbered files must remain useful.
- Fully duplicated retained numbered guides are not allowed as final compatibility because duplicated commands can drift.

## Observability

- Static checks SHOULD report the converted guide path and the missing or invalid structure item.
- Static checks SHOULD distinguish converted guides from not-yet-converted compatibility guides.
- Link checks SHOULD report the source guide, target file, and target anchor when a troubleshooting link fails.
- Review evidence SHOULD record guide path, reviewer, review mode, fast-path/walkthrough parity result, backup-before-edit result, command-context result, expected-result result, and unresolved follow-ups.
- High-risk review evidence SHOULD state whether command blocks were manually reviewed, dry-run reviewed, or not run, and why.
- Completion notes SHOULD list guides converted in the slice and guides intentionally left in old structure.
- Verification guide sequencing evidence SHOULD record that `docs/guides/99-verification.md` is absent from the first smaller-guide conversion slice, that every active path referenced by `docs/guides/99-verification.md` exists after the verification slice, that missing converted guide paths are recorded as unresolved verification follow-ups instead of active verification links, and that static link checks pass for active verification references.

## Security and privacy

- This spec does not introduce authentication, authorization, telemetry, network calls, or credential storage.
- Converted guides MUST NOT include real credentials, tokens, private hostnames, private package indexes, private certificate material, personal paths, or private machine names.
- uv package-index examples MUST use credential-free placeholder-safe values and MUST avoid examples that persist secrets into shell history or committed files.
- Commands that affect execution policy, administrator settings, package sources, WSL global configuration, sudoers, fstab, proxy behavior, trust stores, or editor runtime state MUST call out impact near the affected command or in visible metadata.
- Review evidence and dry-run notes MUST NOT capture private machine data, private hostnames, tokens, proxy credentials, or personal paths beyond documented generic examples.

## Accessibility and UX

- Converted guide titles and router labels MUST use concrete task language that is understandable without knowing repository internals.
- Converted guide metadata SHOULD be short enough to scan before the first setup command.
- `Fast path` and `Walkthrough` headings MUST remain stable and searchable.
- Inline troubleshooting links SHOULD use surrounding text that names the failure symptom.
- Compatibility stubs MUST state where the reader should go next and why the old path no longer contains the full commands.
- The router SHOULD group entries by reader intent while migration is in progress.

## Performance expectations

- Static structure and link checks SHOULD run locally without requiring Windows, WSL, Neovim, tmux, uv, or network access.
- Static checks MUST NOT execute setup commands from guide code blocks.
- Static checks SHOULD finish quickly enough for normal documentation review; if a check becomes slow because of repository size, the test spec should define scoped path checks for converted guides.
- Converted fast paths SHOULD keep the first actionable command and the top-level verification visible near the top of the guide.

## Edge cases

EC1. A converted guide has one meaningful step; it still uses a numbered step so failure reports have a stable reference.

EC2. A converted guide has multiple valid environment branches; the fast path uses the documented default or routes to clearly labeled choices, while the walkthrough explains branch selection.

EC3. A converted guide is mostly verification-only; rollback can be marked not applicable when it does not hide a recovery need.

EC4. A converted guide creates a new disposable project-owned file with no prior user state; backup can be marked not applicable with that concrete reason.

EC5. A converted guide includes a package-source example; the example must be credential-free and must not look like a real private host.

EC6. A converted guide needs a troubleshooting anchor that does not exist; the same slice can add the anchor, or the guide can use a short local failure note and record a troubleshooting follow-up.

EC7. A numbered guide has incoming links; final filename migration uses a compatibility stub rather than deleting the numbered file.

EC8. A WSL migration reader starts in the wrong guide; the WSL install and migration guides should route between each other by starting state.

EC9. A compatibility stub needs to prove it is the old path; it may include a short explanation and links, but it must not duplicate setup commands.

EC10. A static check cannot reliably infer backup-before-edit for all guide prose; the test spec may combine static checks for obvious structure with required review evidence for judgment-heavy coverage.

## Non-goals

- Changing approved PowerShell, WSL, Ubuntu, Neovim, tmux, uv, proxy, sudoers, fstab, package-source, or mount command semantics.
- Executing guide command blocks in CI.
- Creating generated documentation, a custom static-site pipeline, a guide scaffolder, a wizard, or an installer.
- Completing broad unnumbered filename migration in the same slice as body conformance.
- Removing numbered guide paths without redirect-style compatibility.
- Creating deep troubleshooting content inside guide pages.
- Creating tutorial-style beginner documentation under `docs/guides/`.
- Moving optional uv guidance out of `docs/guides/` during this rollout.
- Replacing `proxy-setup.md` or `03-ubuntu-baseline.md` as the settled template exemplar and portability pilot.

## Open questions

None blocking spec review.

The later final filename-migration slice may decide exact canonical filenames for Windows host, Neovim, tmux, uv, verification, and fresh setup, but that decision is outside this spec's body-conformance scope except for the WSL split paths defined here.
